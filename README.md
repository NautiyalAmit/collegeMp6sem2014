- Algo for :These days we have a huge collection of photos for any occasion taken from digital 
cameras and mobile phones. The old saying 'a picture is worth a thousand words'
is very true with this: an event can be more appropriately described by seeing these pictures rather 
than describing it with hundreds of lines. Think of any event: a birthday party, a tennis match, 
a picnic tripâ€¦you name it. There will be hundreds of photos. Some photos will be very similar as 
people click two-three photos (one more-one more), photos taken during different times of the whole
event etc. The task is to describe the event completely by taking minimum number of the photos from
all the available photos of the event. For example if there are 200 photos of an event you need to 
select, say, 50 photos which will describe the whole event. A person needs to simply go through the 
50 photos and understand what the event was about and what happened in that event. Propose an algorithm 
to do this automatically.
