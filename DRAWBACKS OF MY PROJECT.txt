DESPITE OF FAVORABLE RESULTS  THERE AREA A FEW DRAWBACKS SUCH  AS:



#1     THE  OVERALL TIME REQUIRED IS  HIGH
#2     ALTHOUGH NOT ASKED /REQUIRED BUT STILL I WAS'NT ABLE TO DEVELOP  THIS AS A SOFTWARE
#3     MY PROJECT COULD NOT DEAL WITH VERY  MINUTE DETAILS LIKE: 
	# IF  IMAGES ARE CROPPED OVEALL MATCHING COULD NOT BE DONE
	# DOES NOT WORK IF MATCHING  IS DONE IN DIFFERENT PIXELS (OVERALL PIXEL AND ASPECT RATIOS ARE DIFFERENT)
	#WILL BE DHIFFERENT TO DEAL IF MATCHING IS DONE PORTRAIT  AND LANDSCAPE MODES.
	#ETC
